 4.  Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

 # TASK IN DETAIL:
 # creating the dockerfile to install the jenkins:
   1. The first need was to create the dockerfile which has the required softwares to be installed in a container image so that we can run a container from it. so i created a dockerfile which has jenkins and docker installed and on running container from that image, the jenkins and docker server also starts.
