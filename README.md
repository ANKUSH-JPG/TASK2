#  TASK2
# DEPLOYING THE PHP CODE ON PRODUCTION SERVER AND MONITORING THE CONTAINER.

# TASK COMPLETED IN SHORT:
 1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed  using dockerfile 

 2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.

 3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and  job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 

 4.  Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

 5.  Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image   container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).

 6. Job3 : Test your app if it  is working or not.

 7. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages.
 
 # TASK IN DETAIL:
 # creating the dockerfile to install the jenkins:
   1. The first need was to create the dockerfile which has the required softwares to be installed in a container image so that we can run a container from it. so i created a dockerfile which has jenkins and docker installed and on running container from that image, the jenkins and docker server also starts.

 2. I created a image named jenkins:o with this docker file.

# next is to launch the image :
 1. when we launched the image , jenkins service automatically started in the container and the token was given to us in order to login to jenkins.

# NOW LET US EXPLAIN EACH AND EVERY JOB ONE BY ONE
  # job 1 :( to pull the code from git hub)
  
  1. We created a php file which had the code to be deployed and a mail.py file which will be used later in case the code fails to execute on the testing servers.

we also created a post-commit file that would automatically push the code to the repo present in github. On github we changed the webhook settings and created a hook there that would automatically trigger the jenkins job .
